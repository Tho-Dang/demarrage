### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```




    17




```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hour = minutes // 60
print("200 minutes equal to",hour,"hours")
```

    200 minutes equal to 3 hours
